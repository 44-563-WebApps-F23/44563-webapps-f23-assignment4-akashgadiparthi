<h1>Akash Gadiparthi acts in a play</h1>
<h5>Ghosts Act 1</h5>
<h5>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h5>
<p>
    [A spacious garden-room, with one door to the left, and two doors to the
    right. In the middle of the room a round table, with chairs about it. On
    the table lie books, periodicals, and newspapers. In the foreground to
    the left a window, and by it a small sofa, with a worktable in front of
    it. In the background, the room is continued into a somewhat narrower
    conservatory, the walls of which are formed by large panes of glass. In
    the right-hand wall of the conservatory is a door leading down into
    the garden. Through the glass wall a gloomy fjord landscape is faintly
    visible, veiled by steady rain.]

    [ENGSTRAND, the carpenter, stands by the garden door. His left leg
    is somewhat bent; he has a clump of wood under the sole of his boot.
    REGINA, with an empty garden syringe in her hand, hinders him from
    advancing.]
</p>
<p>
    REGINA. [In a low voice.] What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
    positively dripping.
</p>
<p>
    ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.
</p>
<p>
    REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.
</p>
<p>
    ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
    the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--
</p>
<p>
    REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
    master's asleep upstairs.
